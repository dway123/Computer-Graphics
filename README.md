Here you can find code for a Rubik's cube project completed in WebGL. All functionality has been verified to work locally on Google Chrome 56, no promises if you wish to run on other browsers.

While an optimal experience would be on local, here's a link to a web-hosted version. Note that this web version won't be able to save and load games though
